# machine-learning-operations-test
A test for mid level Machine learninng operations (MLOps) for a company in Thailand

### Instruction

A _junior_ data scientist has prepared a prediction model ready to predict client's orders for a restaurant - given that a scientist has no prior knowledge on machine learning operations and bringing the models up for production, you, as a machine learning engineer, has to bring this model to live by yourself. Please *demonstrate* how would you do it. 

Fork this repo and make this model ready to deploy on GCP on any suitable service of your choice
